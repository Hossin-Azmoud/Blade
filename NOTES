Colors: Learning bout colors: https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/about-ncurses-colors-0
I Need:
    [*] Pick better coloring for the editor.
    [*] Modes (Normal, Visual, Insert).
    [*] Add copy/paste functionality
    [*] Organize features!
    [*]  Handle Shift + key
    [*]  Handle mouse pressing.
    [*] remove the old way of copy paste and introdude a struct.. ClipBoard to be used as a storage for any coppied or deled lines.
    PROTO:

    [*] add some keybindings[*]  add text highlighting for python as a test..
    [*]  Make the editor know which script it is edeting then apply this to the lexer so the syntax highlighting becomes better.
    []  add the cut capability. <- Working here.
    [...]  refactor -> Working Here.
    [...]  Work on colors and UI. -> Working Here.
    [...]  add the file browser.
    [*] Fix the cut, copy, paste and refactor this feature.
    [] add types for c and python so u can add new types and colorize them differantly. 
    
    []  Commads (Change file name, atleast).

review@1: [FIXED, most of it.]
0 -> When I past coppied contant it makes a new line before inserting the coppied content. which is not good. [FIXED]
1 -> I need to click f2 twice in order for the editor to quit, it should be only once. [FIXED]
2 -> `c` copy key should kill a certain cut region, not just delete the content that the region holds. (...)
    1 -> cutting content from a line and pasting it works. however, it does not work if I want to cut a whole chunk of data (Multline).
4 -> there is a bug in the cutting functionality that makes the x -> -4 for some reason.

0 - The File browser does not display any informations about the current viewd dir. I need to implement some 
to display info.
1 - The Text Editor has no proper name lol.
