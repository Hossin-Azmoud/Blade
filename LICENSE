review:
0 -> When I past coppied contant it makes a new line before inserting the coppied content. which is not good. [FIXED]
1 -> I need to click f2 twice in order for the editor to quit, it should be only once. [FIXED]
2 -> `c` copy key should kill a certain cut region, not just delete the content that the region holds. (...)
    1 -> cutting content from a line and pasting it works. however, it does not work if I want to cut a whole chunk of data (Multline).
4 -> there is a bug in the cutting functionality that makes the x -> -4 for some reason.
